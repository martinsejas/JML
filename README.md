#  Java Machine Learning (JML)
Welcome to JML, a Java implementation of basic clustering techniques from scratch using the MNIST dataset. This project made me expand my technical ability in Java programming as well as my knowledge in machine learning by solving problems covered by popular Python packages such as Pandas and Sklearn.

Throughout this project, I have expanded my skills in Java programming and machine learning, learning to overcome the challenges of implementing algorithms from scratch. I aimed to develop robust object-oriented code and implemented  testing to ensure that all of my code was reliable and efficient. The aim of this project was NOT to achieve good AI metrics.

This project originally stemmed from a course of my Artificial Intelligence Master's but I went beyond the scope of the assignment attempting to explore various implementations of AI in Java.

I thoroughly enjoyed developing my skills in other programming languages that are not Python,  and to gain another perspective in machine learning.

## Exploring the Code

The best way to explore the code is to clone this repository in your local machine, and opening it in a IDE, preferably IntelliJ Idea (JetBrains) which is the one that was used to create this project. 

If not I do recommend starting on the folder *src/main* which is the main starting point. Under *src/* we also have the folder *test/* containing all of the testing code.

I have also included the original assignment prompt as a PDF, which should help make sense of the code (with permission of my University), feel free to explore the code, I made sure to comment as thoroughly as possible. 

If any doubts, clarifications or feedback please feel free to contact me. 


Thank you for checking out my work.
